1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files for styling. It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting purposes.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the index.html file. It will also import the Tailwind CSS file for additional styling.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file that will provide utility classes for styling the website. It will be imported into the styles.css file and its classes will be used in the index.html file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the HTML file that can be used for styling and scripting. They will be shared between the index.html and styles.css files.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for styling rules in the CSS files. They will be shared between the index.html, styles.css, and tailwind.css files.

3. CSS Import: The Tailwind CSS file will be imported into the styles.css file, creating a dependency between these two files.

4. HTML Link: The CSS files will be linked in the HTML file, creating a dependency between the index.html and the CSS files.
